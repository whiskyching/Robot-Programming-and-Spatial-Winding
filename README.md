# Robot-Programming-and-Spatial-Winding
This Research follows an integrated co-design methodology in which geometry and material characteristics are tightly integrated with novel robotic fabrication techniques. The research focuses specifically on the development of the heterogeneous multi-robot fabrication system which allowed the fabrication of a long-spanning lightweight spatial structure through the introduction of fiber-fiber wound nodes.
